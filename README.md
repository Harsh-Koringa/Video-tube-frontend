### üîç Project Highlights:

**Video Upload & Management:**
- Implemented robust video processing and streaming similar to YouTube's core functionalities.

**Social Interactions:**
- Integrated features akin to Twitter, including posting short updates, replies, and likes.

**Scalable Architecture:**
- Focused on building a scalable and secure backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, ensuring the system can handle significant loads with ease.

This project was not just about coding but also about learning. I refined my backend and frontend skills, delved deep into system design, and enhanced my understanding of complex, scalable architectures. 

### *Cold Start :* 
I am using free service of render of after a period of inactivity render automatically spin down to conserve resources so the first request after a period of inactivity can take significantly longer, often 50 seconds or more, as the instance has to "wake up."
To handle this problem i am using a Keep Alive Server Technique using UptimeRobot
